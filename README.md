Some of my initial stage algorithms.

The algorithms shared here are for those who want to see how a backtest can be done without any extra packages and how the algos could be used to trade stocks in Borsa Istanbul (BIST). Yes, I could make the codes more efficient and faster, however being fast is not the issue here as the difference will only be seconds in that regard, this is not an HFT algo or something.

Please note that I keep complex and sophisticated algorithms for my personal use. These are just some "drafts" to present my algorithmic thinking.
